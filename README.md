// Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
/* ItemTracker.cpp - This was our final project of the course. The goal was to parse a list of grocery items retrieved from an input file, summarize and display the items based on user input, and output a summarized list to a file.
*/

// What did you do particularly well?
/* I broke down the problem into small manageable functions and methodically designed, developed, and tested each subfunction until the overall goal was met.
*/

// Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
/* Many of the functions could have been moved to separate classes and files. This could include the I/O and Menu display functions. This would make the main function more readable and the overall program more easily maintained by a team of developers for future enhancements. There could also be more data validation code when reading the input file or accepting user menu option choices. This would make the program more robust and less susceptable to invalid data or poor user experience.
*/

// Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
/* I found the vector parsing loop logic challenging. Using pseudocode and carefully thinking through the logic helped but a flowchart might have also been beneficial. I intend on using a charting program more consistently going forward. Also, I did not use pointers in this program as this is still a challenging topic for me that will require more in depth practice.
*/

// What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
/* Familiarity with C++ syntax is helpful as well as the concept of multiple classes and headers. Reinforcement of most of the OOP concepts covered in Java/Python courses is also helpful.
*/

// How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
/* Commenting and coding conventions are key. Breaking out classes is also important.
